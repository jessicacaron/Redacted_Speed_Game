## Project Description:

The login system passwords are hashed with salt on the server end.

A functioning main chat room, allowing one user to create a room, and another to join a room.

The gameplay is as follows:
Upon a second player joining a game, both players push a button to signal they are ready to start. Only when both players have signaled will the game supply a countdown timer of 5 seconds. After those five seconds, deal cards into appropriate piles and seen by appropriate players. The room's single deck of cards is managed by the server, and the server sends info about each pile to each player. If a player leaves, both players are sent back to the main lobby.
